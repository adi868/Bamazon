# Bamazon

## Overview 
Bamazon is a command line interface application from which users can request and place real-time orders through a virtual storefront. Using the power of MySQL, Javascript, and Node.js, users can interact with Bamazon as a real customer from which the app will take in orders and deplete stock from the store's inventory.

## How does it work?
To run this program, a couple steps of setup is required. First, make sure you have the appropriate `npm` packages installed on your computer.
Next, run bamazon in your terminal. Type in `node bamazonCustomer.js`. This will run the Bamazon application. From there, Bamazon will prompt the user through a series of selections. The user can navigate through the menu options to select their requested action from the list. Bamazon will then search the database for your requested item ID, match your chosen selection, check whether the request can be completed, and, if so, calculate your total cost of your transaction. All at the same time, updating the stock's inventory. Try it out yourself, saavy shoppers!
